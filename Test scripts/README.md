# Test scripts
This section have two scripts, for teams that have ability to use custom port number (like Agent2d) and teams that only use default port numer (like UvA trilearn)

For teams that have ability to use custom port number, use `multigame.sh`, otherwise use `multigametril.sh`.

If you need to kill all instances at once, use `masterkill.sh`, **but** it will kill all instances, includind instances outside this scripts.
