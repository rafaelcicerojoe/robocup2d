Is recommended to clone at least this folder, in order to execute complete installation.

To do a complete install, simply run `setup.sh`.

This will install:
1.  RoboCup server (`rcssserver`)
2.  RoboCup monitor (`rcssmonitor`)
3.  RoboCup soccersim (server + monitor) (`rcsoccersim`)
1.  Robocup logplayer (`rcsslogplayer`)
1.  Librcsc (Library necessary to run the server)
4.  Base team UvA Trilearn (Modified by PET-ES to be compatible with last version server)
5.  Base team Agent2d
6.  Fedit (Graphical formarion editor for base team Agent2d)

And run `fix_decimal_separator(comma).sh` **if your system** use comma (",") as decimal separator instead of dot (".").
